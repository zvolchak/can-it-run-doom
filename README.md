### Introduction

https://canitrundoom.org

The tradition of porting Doom began in 1997 when its source code was officially [open-sourced](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM). Since then, Doom has been extensively modded, 
its code forked thousands of times, and ported to an incredible variety of platforms and devices. These range from printers, phones, and 
digital cameras to ATMs, satellites, LEGO brick displays, and beyond.

CanItRunDoom.org is dedicated to preserving the legacy of Doom ports, archiving all known projects, and celebrating the creativity and 
dedication of the community that has kept this tradition alive.
